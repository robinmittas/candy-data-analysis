## Candy Data Analysis
Here I analyzed the `candy-data.csv` to extract features for a new candy. The goal is to maximize the profit by choosing the respective features. I here used some explorative data analysis, linear regression and key driver analysis to extract the features that promise the highest profit. A managment summary in german is also uploaded for visualization purposes.
